# Foundry

Foundry is a personal prototyping runtime for building full-stack tools with speed, clarity, and composure.

It is designed to eliminate setup friction by providing:
- An opinionated UI system built on industry-standard primitives
- A lightweight runtime shell for applications
- A consistent data and state model
- Documented architectural decisions and principles

Foundry is not a framework.
It is a toolkit, a stance, and a long-term investment in calm product creation.

## What lives here
- Reusable packages (`/packages`)
- Proof-of-use apps (`/apps`)
- Product thinking and decisions (`/docs`)

## Why
To build many tools over time without losing taste, confidence, or structural clarity.

See `/docs/PRD.md` to understand the intent behind this system.
